    <strong>First Step</strong> to designing your own nails is gathering the materials.
    You will need...
    <ol>Nail Polish</ol>
    <ol>Nail Gel</ol>
    <ol>Plain Nails</ol>
    <ol>Styling Tools</ol>
    <ol>LeD lamp</ol>
    </ol>
    Match the sizes of each nail to the size needed for the figure. Remember you need to find matches for <em>both hands</em> (10 fingers).
    Once they have been chosen, start by placing one nail in front of yourself, grabbing your tools and it is time to begin.

  <strong>Second Step</strong> begin painting the nails with the colour of your choice. Do soft strokes from the top of the nail, to the bottom.
  After the first coat, place nails into the LED light dryer. This will help to hold and secure the paint. Do this for all nails.
  Continue to repeat this set up to <em>three times</em> on each nail.
